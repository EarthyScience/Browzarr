### Lower and upper bounds
You can control the lower and upper bounds of your displayed data by clicking and typing different numbers in the input boxes (extreme left and right).

### Shift values

Dragging the colorbar itself will also shift the bound values.

### Attributes
Clicking on the variable name (at the top of the colorbar) will also display their general attributes!
