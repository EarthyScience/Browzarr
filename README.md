# Wishlist/Todo

_*Not essential_

### Data
- [ ] Add zarr url input
- [x] Get metadata from ds/variable
- [ ] Handle 2D variables
- [ ] _Export to zarr (Like analysis data)*_

### Plot Window
- [x] Feed coords into and apply to ticks
- [x] move ticks with camera
- [x] Add position/coords of click/timeseries
- [x] _Resize the canvas/window*_
- [x] Selectable points 
- [x] Show points with information (Value and coords)
- [x] Scale axis'
- [ ] Add option to enable/disable timeseries selection to prevent misclicks

### Visuals
- [ ] _Highlight series column in volume*_

### UI
- [ ] Breakup UI into seperate windows or sections
  - [ ]  Data
  - [ ]  Visuals
  - [ ]  Plotting
  - [ ]  Analysis
- [ ] Implement a more reactive UI (Tweakpane/[UIkit](https://github.com/pmndrs/uikit))

### Analysis
- [ ] Along axis calculations
  - [ ] Average
  - [ ] Median
  - [ ] Min
  - [ ] Max
- [ ] Two Variable Calculations
  - [ ] Correlation
- [ ] _Window operations*_
  - [ ] RaoQ
  - [ ] Min/Max/Mean
  - [ ] Gaussian smooth
- [ ] Implement as Compute shaders for blazing speed

### Misc.
- [ ] Export view as image (w/ and w/out background)
- [ ] _Animations?*_
- [ ] _Flip time axis so looking past to future instead of future to past*_

### Bugs/Fixes
- [x] Verify Timeslices are in correct positions
- [ ] Scale the timeseries selection with plot resolution
- [x] Vertical scaling on resize is off between line and horizontal bars
- [x] Grid lines cull when centers are out of view
- [ ] Find some way to prevent multiple points being large when highlighting points in
- [ ] Move center of axis of point InstancedMesh with camera so to prevent culling
