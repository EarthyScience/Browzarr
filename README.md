# FireSight
A browser based visualization toolkit for the SeasFire data cube.

## Roadmap 🛣️

Take a peek at what we've already made so far and our future plans for `FireSight`:

- [x] **UI components**
  - Landing page
- [x] **Modal About project**
  - Done by using React Portals and jotai
  - Abstract away into a new component.
- [x] **Footer component**
  - Short description / more?
- [x] **Nav/Icon component**
  - About modal descriptor, plus icon. More options? 
- [x] **Update tweekpane-react**: A PR to original repo has been made, but all changes had been integrated into this app.
  - [x] **Why this? Easy to customize and add new input parameters**
- [x] **Define a simple colormap mapping**
  - Maps values to rgb colors from a colormap
- [ ] **Do a good colormap selector**
- [ ] **Cube geometry / shader**
- [ ] **Volumetric geometry / shader**
- [ ] **Points / shader**
- [ ] **Load variable for Zarr file**
- [ ] **List all variables in pane controls**
- [ ] **Variable selection and load data**
- [ ] **Pixel selection**
- [ ] **Plot time series per pixel**
- [ ] **Extend to model output**: TODO: Discuss approach and variables of interest.



Please note that these are our current plans and might change based on feedback and development progress. We highly encourage your ideas and contributions in shaping the future of `FireSight`.
